# sorting-algorithm-visualization

This project is an implementation of visualization of sorting algorithms using terminal as an output display. 
The array size and sorting speed is determined by the user and an array is created using given array size which's elements are between 1 - 100.

Currently 4 options are avaible for sorting task:
1. Bubble Sort
2. Insertion Sort
3. Selection Sort
4. Quick Sort

After choosing one of the options, array sorting will be display with considering the given sorting speed. 
Basic Sleep(...) command is used for this sorting duty.
Terminal is clear before starting the display next order of the array. 

Array size maximum 50 to 75 is recommended for easy display. 
Elements' range is chosen between 1 and 100 due to screen size. 
* Some variables are not used in all of the algorithms.

* Flickery display makes things a bit annoying but main working principal can be seen.
* These sorting speeds does not show the real speeds of the algorithms. These are only for visualization.
